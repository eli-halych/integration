Integration Continuous Integration Guide
----------------------------------------

Continuous Integration is key due to the complexity of the ONAP projects.
Several chains have been created:

- Daily stable chain
- Daily master chain
- Gating: On demand deployment of a full ONAP solution to validate patchsets

They are run on different environments.

The following document will detail these chains and how you could set up such
chains and/or provide test results to the community.
